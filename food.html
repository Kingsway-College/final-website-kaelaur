     <p>This is the amazing dish, Grilled Fish. The incredible selection of fish available in Seychelles is the centre of any cuisine. Freshly caught every day and almost always prepared on the grill, this dish offers a unique experience. When prepared with the region's delicious seasoning of lemon juice, ginger, garlic, and chilli, local favourites like red snapper, jobfish, jackfish, sailfish, or parrotfish are absolutely attractive. In the middle of the Indian Ocean, keep an eye out for the local fishermen and their numerous colourful boats as they fish for your dinner.
