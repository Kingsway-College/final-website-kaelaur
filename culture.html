        <p>Seychelles traditions were shaped by African, Indian, British, European, and even Arabic cultures. Creoles' speech and its creative expressions—music, dance, and theater—reflect all of these cultures. The language is the most valuable resource. In 1981, it was given official status. Creoles celebrate music and culture through a variety of festivals held in honour of their native language. Moutia, or rhyming chanting to rhythmic movements, is the most well-known dance in the Seychelles. It travelled from Africa to the islands with the refugees.
